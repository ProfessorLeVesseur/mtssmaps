- **Heat Map Visualization:** Once the data is uploaded, the application generates heat maps that highlight ISDs and Districts. These maps provide a visual representation of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and areas of interest.

- **PSA Visualization:** Public School Academies (PSAs) are marked with pins on the map, offering clear visibility and distinction from other educational entities.

- **Interactive Map Features:** Users can interact with the map, zooming in and out and clicking on specific areas for more detailed information.
